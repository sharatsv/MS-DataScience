HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\n",
      "Mrs. DAVIS of California. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5749, EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008)) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\n",
      "Mrs. NAPOLITANO. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\n",
      "Ms. SCHWARTZ. (WELCOMING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FROM INDONESIA, KENYA, MACEDONIA, AND UKRAINE -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.\n",

I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\n",
      "Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\n",
      "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n",
      "Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B.

      "Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007)) Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\n",
      "Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\n",

Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 203, condemning the persecution of labor rights advocates in Iran; ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 2828, to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998; and ``yea'' on final passage of H.

      "Ms. MATSUI. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.\n",
      "Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n",
      "Ms. KAPTUR. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\n",
      "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. (HONORING NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007)) Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\n",
      "Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n",

Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\u001c",
      "cul\u001c",

      "ism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\n",
      "Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007)) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

      "Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\n",
      "Ms. BALDWIN. (ENCOURAGING DISPLAY OF THE FLAG ON FATHER'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007)) Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",
      "Ms. HOOLEY. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.\n",
      "Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\n",
      "Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007)) Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\n",
      "Ms. DeGETTE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\n",
      "Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\n",
      "Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (NEW HAMPSHIRE STORM -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\n",
      "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)) Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\n",
      "Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\n",
      "Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PASSAGE OF THE HOUSING BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\n",
      "Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. (FLORIDA GATORS 2007 MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007)) Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\n",
      "Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007)) Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.\n",
      "Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\n",
      "Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\n",
      "Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\n",
      "Ms. BEAN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\n",
      "Ms. PELOSI. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\n",
      "Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.\n",
      "Ms. HERSETH. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007)) Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n",
      "Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008)) Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\n",
      "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\n",

After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n",
      "Ms. RICHARDSON. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008)) Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.\n",

      "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\n",

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\n",
      "Mrs. NAPOLITANO. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\n",

      "Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\n",
      "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n",
      "Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B.

      "Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007)) Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\n",
      "Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n",
      "Ms. WOOLSEY. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\n",
      "Ms. KILPATRICK. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H.

      "Ms. MATSUI. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.\n",
      "Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n",
      "Ms. KAPTUR. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\n",
      "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. (HONORING NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007)) Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\n",
      "Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n",
      "Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture.

      "Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007)) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

      "Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\n",
      "Ms. BALDWIN. (ENCOURAGING DISPLAY OF THE FLAG ON FATHER'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007)) Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",
      "Ms. HOOLEY. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.\n",
      "Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\n",
      "Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007)) Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\n",
      "Ms. DeGETTE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\n",
      "Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\n",
      "Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\n",
      "Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PASSAGE OF THE HOUSING BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\n",
      "Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. (FLORIDA GATORS 2007 MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007)) Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\n",
      "Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007)) Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.\n",
      "Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\n",
      "Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\n",
      "Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\n",
      "Ms. BEAN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\n",
      "Ms. PELOSI. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\n",
      "Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.\n",
      "Ms. HERSETH. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007)) Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n",
      "Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008)) Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\n",
      "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\n",

Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n",
      "Ms. RICHARDSON. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008)) Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.\n",

      "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\n",

And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\n",

Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\n",

      "Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\n",
      "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n",
      "Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B.

      "Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007)) Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\n",
      "Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n",
      "Ms. WOOLSEY. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\n",
      "Ms. KILPATRICK. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes.

      "Ms. MATSUI. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.\n",
      "Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n",
      "Ms. KAPTUR. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\n",
      "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. (HONORING NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007)) Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\n",
      "Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n",

(RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H.

Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture.

      "Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007)) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

      "Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\n",
      "Ms. BALDWIN. (ENCOURAGING DISPLAY OF THE FLAG ON FATHER'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007)) Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",
      "Ms. HOOLEY. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.\n",
      "Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\n",
      "Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007)) Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\n",
      "Ms. DeGETTE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\n",
      "Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\n",
      "Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\n",
      "Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PASSAGE OF THE HOUSING BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\n",
      "Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. (FLORIDA GATORS 2007 MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007)) Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\n",
      "Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007)) Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.\n",
      "Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\n",
      "Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\n",
      "Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\n",
      "Ms. BEAN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\n",
      "Ms. PELOSI. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\n",
      "Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.\n",
      "Ms. HERSETH. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007)) Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n",
      "Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008)) Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\n",
      "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\n",

After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\n",
      "Ms. TSONGAS. (HONORING SERGEANT ALEX JIMENEZ -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)) Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n",
      "Ms. RICHARDSON. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008)) Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.\n",

      "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\n",

After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\n",

Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\n",

      "Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\n",
      "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n",
      "Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B.

      "Ms. SLAUGHTER. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007)) Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.\n",
      "Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007)) Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\n",
      "Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n",
      "Ms. WOOLSEY. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\n",

      "Ms. MATSUI. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.\n",
      "Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n",
      "Ms. KAPTUR. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\n",
      "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. (HONORING NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007)) Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\n",
      "Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n",
      "Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\u001c",

      "Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007)) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

      "Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\n",
      "Ms. BALDWIN. (ENCOURAGING DISPLAY OF THE FLAG ON FATHER'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007)) Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.\n",
      "Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\n",
      "Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007)) Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\n",
      "Ms. DeGETTE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\n",

That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\n",
      "Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (NEW HAMPSHIRE STORM -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\n",
      "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)) Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\n",
      "Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\n",
      "Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PASSAGE OF THE HOUSING BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\n",
      "Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. (FLORIDA GATORS 2007 MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007)) Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\n",
      "Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007)) Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.\n",
      "Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\n",
      "Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\n",
      "Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\n",
      "Ms. BEAN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\n",
      "Ms. PELOSI. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.\n",
      "Ms. HERSETH. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007)) Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n",
      "Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008)) Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\n",
      "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\n",

Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\n",
      "Ms. TSONGAS. (HONORING SERGEANT ALEX JIMENEZ -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)) Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n",
      "Ms. RICHARDSON. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008)) Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.\n",

      "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\n",

After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\n",

Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\n",

      "Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\n",
      "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n",
      "Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n",
      "Ms. SLAUGHTER. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007)) Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.\n",
      "Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007)) Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\n",
      "Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n",
      "Ms. WOOLSEY. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\n",

      "Ms. MATSUI. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.\n",
      "Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n",
      "Ms. KAPTUR. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\n",
      "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. (HONORING NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007)) Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\n",
      "Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n",
      "Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\u001c",

      "Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007)) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

      "Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\n",

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.\n",
      "Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\n",
      "Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007)) Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\n",
      "Ms. DeGETTE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\n",
      "Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\n",
      "Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (NEW HAMPSHIRE STORM -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\n",
      "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)) Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\n",
      "Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\n",
      "Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PASSAGE OF THE HOUSING BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\n",
      "Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. (FLORIDA GATORS 2007 MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007)) Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\n",
      "Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007)) Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.\n",
      "Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\n",
      "Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\n",
      "Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\n",
      "Ms. BEAN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\n",
      "Ms. PELOSI. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\n",
      "Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.\n",
      "Ms. HERSETH. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007)) Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n",
      "Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008)) Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\n",
      "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\n",

After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n",
      "Ms. RICHARDSON. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008)) Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H.

      "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\n",

And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\n",

Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\n",

This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\n",
      "Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\n",
      "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n",
      "Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n",

I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.\n",
      "Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007)) Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\n",
      "Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\n",

      "Ms. MATSUI. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.\n",
      "Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n",
      "Ms. KAPTUR. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\n",
      "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. (HONORING NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007)) Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\n",
      "Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n",
      "Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\u001c",

      "Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007)) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

      "Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\n",

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.\n",
      "Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\n",
      "Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007)) Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\n",
      "Ms. DeGETTE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\n",
      "Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\n",
      "Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (NEW HAMPSHIRE STORM -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\n",
      "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)) Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\n",
      "Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\n",
      "Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PASSAGE OF THE HOUSING BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\n",
      "Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. (FLORIDA GATORS 2007 MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007)) Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\n",
      "Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007)) Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.\n",
      "Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\n",
      "Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\n",
      "Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\n",

I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\n",
      "Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.\n",
      "Ms. HERSETH. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007)) Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n",
      "Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008)) Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\n",
      "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\n",

Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\n",
      "Ms. TSONGAS. (HONORING SERGEANT ALEX JIMENEZ -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)) Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n",
      "Ms. RICHARDSON. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008)) Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.\n",

      "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\n",
      "Mrs. DAVIS of California. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5749, EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008)) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\n",
      "Mrs. NAPOLITANO. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\n",
      "Ms. SCHWARTZ. (WELCOMING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FROM INDONESIA, KENYA, MACEDONIA, AND UKRAINE -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.\n",
      "Ms. BERKLEY. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\n",
      "Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\n",
      "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n",
      "Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n",

I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.\n",
      "Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007)) Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\n",
      "Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\n",

      "Ms. MATSUI. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.\n",
      "Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n",
      "Ms. KAPTUR. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\n",
      "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. (HONORING NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007)) Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\n",
      "Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n",
      "Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\u001c",

      "Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007)) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado.

      "Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\n",
      "Ms. BALDWIN. (ENCOURAGING DISPLAY OF THE FLAG ON FATHER'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007)) Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",
      "Ms. HOOLEY. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.\n",
      "Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\n",
      "Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007)) Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\n",
      "Ms. DeGETTE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\n",
      "Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\n",
      "Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (NEW HAMPSHIRE STORM -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\n",
      "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)) Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\n",
      "Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\n",
      "Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PASSAGE OF THE HOUSING BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\n",
      "Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. (FLORIDA GATORS 2007 MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007)) Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\n",
      "Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007)) Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.\n",
      "Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\n",
      "Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\n",
      "Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\n",
      "Ms. BEAN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\n",
      "Ms. PELOSI. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\n",
      "Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.\n",
      "Ms. HERSETH. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007)) Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n",
      "Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008)) Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\n",
      "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\n",

After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n",
      "Ms. RICHARDSON. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008)) Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.\n",

      "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\n",

(PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5749, EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008)) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\n",
      "Mrs. NAPOLITANO. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\n",
      "Ms. SCHWARTZ. (WELCOMING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FROM INDONESIA, KENYA, MACEDONIA, AND UKRAINE -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.\n",

I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

      "Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\n",
      "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n",
      "Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n",

      "Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007)) Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\n",
      "Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\n",

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.\n",
      "Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n",

Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\n",
      "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. (HONORING NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007)) Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\n",
      "Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n",

(RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture.

      "Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007)) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

      "Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\n",
      "Ms. BALDWIN. (ENCOURAGING DISPLAY OF THE FLAG ON FATHER'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007)) Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",
      "Ms. HOOLEY. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.\n",
      "Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\n",
      "Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007)) Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\n",
      "Ms. DeGETTE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\n",
      "Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\n",
      "Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (NEW HAMPSHIRE STORM -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses.

      "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)) Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\n",
      "Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\n",
      "Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PASSAGE OF THE HOUSING BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\n",
      "Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007)) Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.\n",
      "Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\n",
      "Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\n",
      "Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\n",
      "Ms. BEAN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\n",
      "Ms. PELOSI. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\n",
      "Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.\n",
      "Ms. HERSETH. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007)) Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n",
      "Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008)) Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\n",
      "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\n",

After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\n",

There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n",
      "Ms. RICHARDSON. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008)) Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H.

      "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\n",

(PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5749, EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008)) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\n",
      "Mrs. NAPOLITANO. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\n",

Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.\n",

This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

      "Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\n",
      "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n",
      "Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B.

      "Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007)) Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\n",
      "Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\n",

      "Ms. MATSUI. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.\n",
      "Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n",
      "Ms. KAPTUR. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\n",
      "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. (HONORING NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007)) Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\n",
      "Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n",

(RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\u001c",

      "Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007)) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

      "Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\n",
      "Ms. BALDWIN. (ENCOURAGING DISPLAY OF THE FLAG ON FATHER'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007)) Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",
      "Ms. HOOLEY. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.\n",
      "Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\n",
      "Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007)) Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\n",
      "Ms. DeGETTE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\n",
      "Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\n",
      "Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (NEW HAMPSHIRE STORM -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\n",
      "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)) Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\n",
      "Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\n",
      "Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PASSAGE OF THE HOUSING BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\n",
      "Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007)) Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.\n",
      "Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\n",

It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\n",
      "Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\n",
      "Ms. BEAN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\n",
      "Ms. PELOSI. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\n",
      "Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.\n",
      "Ms. HERSETH. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007)) Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n",
      "Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008)) Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\n",
      "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\n",

After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\n",

There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.\n",

      "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",

HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\n",

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\n",
      "Mrs. NAPOLITANO. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\n",

      "Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\n",
      "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n",
      "Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B.

      "Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007)) Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\n",
      "Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n",
      "Ms. WOOLSEY. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\n",
      "Ms. KILPATRICK. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes.

      "Ms. MATSUI. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.\n",
      "Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n",
      "Ms. KAPTUR. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\n",
      "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. (HONORING NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007)) Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\n",
      "Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)) Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n",
      "Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)) Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\u001c",

      "Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007)) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

      "Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\n",
      "Ms. BALDWIN. (ENCOURAGING DISPLAY OF THE FLAG ON FATHER'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007)) Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n",
      "Ms. HOOLEY. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.\n",
      "Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\n",
      "Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007)) Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\n",
      "Ms. DeGETTE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\n",
      "Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\n",

Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\n",
      "Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\n",

Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\n",

The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.\n",
      "Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\n",
      "Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\n",
      "Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\n",
      "Ms. BEAN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)) Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\n",
      "Ms. PELOSI. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008)) Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\n",
      "Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)) Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.\n",
      "Ms. HERSETH. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007)) Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n",
      "Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008)) Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\n",
      "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007)) Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\n",
      "Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5818, NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)) Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.\n",
      "Ms. SOLIS. (HOUSE DEMOCRATS PROTECT CHILDREN AND CONSUMERS WITH NEW LEGISLATION SCHEDULED FOR TODAY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008)) Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\n",
      "Ms. TSONGAS. (HONORING SERGEANT ALEX JIMENEZ -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)) Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n",
      "Ms. RICHARDSON. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008)) Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.\n"

      "[\"Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, due to events scheduled in my district, I will miss votes on January 29, 2008. Please let the Record reflect that had I been present, my vote would have reflected the following:H.R. 5140 Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008--``yea.''H.R. 1528 New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act--``aye.''H.R. 933 Commending the Louisiana State University Tigers Football Team--``yea.''\", \"Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", \"Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\", \"Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\", \"Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\", 'Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.', \"Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\", \"Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\", \"Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\", \"Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\", 'Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.', \"Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\", \"Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\", \"Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\", \"Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\", \"Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith; ``yea'' on final passage of H.

Con. Res. 200, condemning the violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful demonstrators in Burma and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\", 'Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.', \"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\", \"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\", \"Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\", \"Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\", \"Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\\x1ccul\\x1ctural\\x1cism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\", \"Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\", \"Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", 'Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.', \"Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\", \"Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\", \"Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\", \"Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\", \"Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\", \"Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\", \"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\", \"Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\", \"Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\", 'Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.', \"Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\", \"Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\", \"Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\", \"Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\", \"Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\", 'Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.', \"Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\", \"Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\", \"Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\", 'Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.', \"Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\", \"Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\", 'Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.', \"Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, due to events scheduled in my district, I will miss votes on January 29, 2008. Please let the Record reflect that had I been present, my vote would have reflected the following:H.R. 5140 Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008--``yea.''H.R. 1528 New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act--``aye.''H.R. 933 Commending the Louisiana State University Tigers Football Team--``yea.''\", \"Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", \"Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\", \"Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\", \"Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\", 'Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.', \"Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\", \"Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\", \"Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\", \"Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\", 'Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.', \"Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\", \"Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\", \"Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\", \"Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\", \"Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 203, condemning the persecution of labor rights advocates in Iran; ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 2828, to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998; and ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 200, condemning the violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful demonstrators in Burma and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\", 'Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.', \"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\", \"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\", \"Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\", \"Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\", \"Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\\x1ccul\\x1ctural\\x1cism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\", \"Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\", \"Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", 'Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.', \"Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\", \"Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\", \"Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\", \"Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\", \"Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\", \"Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\", \"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\", \"Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\", \"Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\", 'Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.', \"Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\", \"Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\", \"Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\", \"Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\", \"Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\", 'Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.', \"Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\", \"Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\", \"Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\", 'Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.', \"Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\", \"Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\", 'Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.', \"Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, due to events scheduled in my district, I will miss votes on January 29, 2008. Please let the Record reflect that had I been present, my vote would have reflected the following:H.R. 5140 Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008--``yea.''H.R. 1528 New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act--``aye.''H.R. 933 Commending the Louisiana State University Tigers Football Team--``yea.''\", \"Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", \"Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\", \"Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\", \"Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\", 'Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.', \"Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\", \"Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\", \"Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\", \"Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B.

I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.', \"Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\", \"Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\", \"Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\", \"Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\", \"Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 203, condemning the persecution of labor rights advocates in Iran; ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 2828, to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998; and ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 200, condemning the violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful demonstrators in Burma and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\", 'Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.', \"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\", \"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\", \"Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\", \"Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\", \"Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\\x1ccul\\x1ctural\\x1cism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\", \"Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I missed three votes today due to an emergency dental procedure. Had I been present, I would have voted as follows:Rollcall vote 524: ``yes'' on motion on ordering the previous question on the rule providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules (H. Res. 1367).Rollcall vote 525: ``yes'' on H.

Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (H. Res. 1362).\", \"Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\", \"Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", 'Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.', \"Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\", \"Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\", \"Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\", \"Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\", \"Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\", \"Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\", \"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\", \"Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\", \"Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\", 'Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.', \"Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\", \"Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\", \"Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\", \"Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\", \"Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\", 'Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.', \"Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\", \"Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\", \"Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\", 'Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.', \"Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\", \"Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\", 'Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.', \"Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, due to events scheduled in my district, I will miss votes on January 29, 2008. Please let the Record reflect that had I been present, my vote would have reflected the following:H.R. 5140 Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008--``yea.''H.R. 1528 New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act--``aye.''H.R. 933 Commending the Louisiana State University Tigers Football Team--``yea.''\", \"Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", \"Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\", \"Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\", \"Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\", 'Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.', \"Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\", \"Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\", \"Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\", \"Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\", 'Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.', \"Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\", \"Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\", \"Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\", \"Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\", \"Ms. KILPATRICK.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.', \"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\", \"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\", \"Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\", \"Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\", \"Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\\x1ccul\\x1ctural\\x1cism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\", \"Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I missed three votes today due to an emergency dental procedure. Had I been present, I would have voted as follows:Rollcall vote 524: ``yes'' on motion on ordering the previous question on the rule providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules (H.

Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\", \"Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", 'Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.', \"Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\", \"Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\", \"Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\", \"Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\", \"Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\", \"Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\", \"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\", \"Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\", \"Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\", 'Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.', \"Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\", \"Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\", \"Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\", \"Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\", \"Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\", 'Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.', \"Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\", \"Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\", \"Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\", 'Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.', \"Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\", \"Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\", 'Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.', \"Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, due to events scheduled in my district, I will miss votes on January 29, 2008. Please let the Record reflect that had I been present, my vote would have reflected the following:H.R. 5140 Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008--``yea.''H.R. 1528 New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act--``aye.''H.R. 933 Commending the Louisiana State University Tigers Football Team--``yea.''\", \"Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", \"Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\", \"Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\", \"Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\", 'Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.', \"Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\", \"Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\", \"Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\", \"Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\", 'Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.', \"Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\", \"Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\", \"Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\", \"Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\", \"Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 203, condemning the persecution of labor rights advocates in Iran; ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 2828, to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998; and ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 200, condemning the violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful demonstrators in Burma and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\", 'Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.', \"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\", \"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\", \"Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\", \"Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\", \"Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\\x1ccul\\x1ctural\\x1cism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\", \"Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I missed three votes today due to an emergency dental procedure. Had I been present, I would have voted as follows:Rollcall vote 524: ``yes'' on motion on ordering the previous question on the rule providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules (H. Res. 1367).Rollcall vote 525: ``yes'' on H. Res. 1367, the rule providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules.Rollcall vote 526: ``yes'' on motion on ordering the previous question on the rule for H.R. 5501--Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (H. Res. 1362).\", \"Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\", \"Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", 'Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.', \"Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\", \"Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\", \"Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\", \"Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\", \"Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\", \"Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\", \"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\", \"Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\", \"Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\", 'Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.', \"Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\", \"Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\", \"Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\", \"Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\", \"Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\", 'Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.', \"Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\", \"Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\", \"Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\", 'Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.', \"Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\", \"Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\", 'Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.', \"Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, due to events scheduled in my district, I will miss votes on January 29, 2008. Please let the Record reflect that had I been present, my vote would have reflected the following:H.R. 5140 Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008--``yea.''H.R. 1528 New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act--``aye.''H.R. 933 Commending the Louisiana State University Tigers Football Team--``yea.''\", \"Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", \"Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\", \"Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\", \"Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\", 'Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.', \"Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\", \"Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\", \"Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\", \"Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\", 'Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.', \"Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\", \"Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\", \"Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\", \"Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\", \"Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 203, condemning the persecution of labor rights advocates in Iran; ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 2828, to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998; and ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 200, condemning the violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful demonstrators in Burma and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\", 'Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.', \"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\", \"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\", \"Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\", \"Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\", \"Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\\x1ccul\\x1ctural\\x1cism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\", \"Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\", \"Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", 'Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.', \"Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\", \"Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\", \"Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\", \"Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\", \"Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\", \"Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\", \"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\", \"Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\", \"Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\", 'Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.', \"Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\", \"Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\", \"Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\", \"Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\", \"Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\", 'Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.', \"Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\", \"Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\", \"Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\", 'Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.', \"Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\", \"Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\", 'Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.', \"Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, due to events scheduled in my district, I will miss votes on January 29, 2008. Please let the Record reflect that had I been present, my vote would have reflected the following:H.R. 5140 Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008--``yea.''H.R. 1528 New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act--``aye.''H.R. 933 Commending the Louisiana State University Tigers Football Team--``yea.''\", \"Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", \"Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\", \"Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\", \"Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\", 'Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.', \"Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\", \"Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\", \"Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\", \"Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\", 'Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.', \"Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\", \"Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\", \"Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\", \"Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\", \"Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 203, condemning the persecution of labor rights advocates in Iran; ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 2828, to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998; and ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 200, condemning the violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful demonstrators in Burma and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\", 'Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.', \"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\", \"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\", \"Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\", \"Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\", \"Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\\x1ccul\\x1ctural\\x1cism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\", \"Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\", \"Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", 'Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.', \"Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\", \"Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\", \"Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\", \"Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\", \"Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\", \"Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\", \"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\", \"Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\", \"Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\", 'Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.', \"Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\", \"Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\", \"Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\", \"Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\", \"Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\", 'Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.', \"Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\", \"Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\", \"Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\", 'Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.', \"Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\", \"Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\", 'Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.', \"Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, due to events scheduled in my district, I will miss votes on January 29, 2008. Please let the Record reflect that had I been present, my vote would have reflected the following:H.R. 5140 Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008--``yea.''H.R. 1528 New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act--``aye.''H.R. 933 Commending the Louisiana State University Tigers Football Team--``yea.''\", \"Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", \"Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\", \"Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\", \"Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\", 'Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.', \"Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\", \"Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\", \"Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\", \"Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B.

I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.', \"Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\", \"Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\", \"Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\", \"Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\", \"Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 203, condemning the persecution of labor rights advocates in Iran; ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 2828, to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998; and ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 200, condemning the violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful demonstrators in Burma and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\", 'Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.', \"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\", \"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\", \"Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\", \"Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\", \"Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\\x1ccul\\x1ctural\\x1cism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\", \"Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I missed three votes today due to an emergency dental procedure.

Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\", \"Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", 'Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.', \"Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\", \"Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\", \"Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\", \"Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\", \"Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\", \"Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\", \"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\", \"Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\", \"Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\", 'Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.', \"Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\", \"Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\", \"Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\", \"Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\", \"Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\", 'Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.', \"Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\", \"Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\", \"Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\", 'Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.', \"Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\", \"Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\", 'Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.', \"Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, due to events scheduled in my district, I will miss votes on January 29, 2008. Please let the Record reflect that had I been present, my vote would have reflected the following:H.R. 5140 Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008--``yea.''H.R. 1528 New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act--``aye.''H.R. 933 Commending the Louisiana State University Tigers Football Team--``yea.''\", \"Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", \"Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\", \"Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\", \"Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\", 'Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.', \"Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\", \"Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\", \"Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\", \"Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\", 'Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.', \"Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\", \"Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\", \"Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\", \"Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\", \"Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 203, condemning the persecution of labor rights advocates in Iran; ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 2828, to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998; and ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 200, condemning the violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful demonstrators in Burma and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\", 'Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.', \"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\", \"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\", \"Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\", \"Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\", \"Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\\x1ccul\\x1ctural\\x1cism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\", \"Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I missed three votes today due to an emergency dental procedure. Had I been present, I would have voted as follows:Rollcall vote 524: ``yes'' on motion on ordering the previous question on the rule providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules (H. Res. 1367).Rollcall vote 525: ``yes'' on H. Res. 1367, the rule providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules.Rollcall vote 526: ``yes'' on motion on ordering the previous question on the rule for H.R. 5501--Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (H. Res. 1362).\", \"Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\", \"Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", 'Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.', \"Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\", \"Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\", \"Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\", \"Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\", \"Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\", \"Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\", \"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\", \"Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\", \"Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\", 'Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.', \"Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\", \"Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\", \"Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\", \"Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\", \"Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\", 'Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.', \"Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\", \"Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\", \"Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\", 'Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.', \"Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\", \"Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\", 'Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.', \"Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, due to events scheduled in my district, I will miss votes on January 29, 2008. Please let the Record reflect that had I been present, my vote would have reflected the following:H.R. 5140 Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008--``yea.''H.R. 1528 New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act--``aye.''H.R. 933 Commending the Louisiana State University Tigers Football Team--``yea.''\", \"Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals.Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic.The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide.Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children.These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges.The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names.The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions.Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.''So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security.It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved.Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception.After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise.The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability.Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring.The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending.It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services.With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas.Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today.We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security.I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives.With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", \"Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time.Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park.The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid.``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.''Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.\", \"Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to.Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy.Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning.To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back.I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.\", \"Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding the time. I am rising in support, in very strong support of the manager's amendment which includes some very important provisions especially the one regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and the raising of the stations' platforms. The Los Angeles Metrolink and many other commuter railroads have fully complied with ADA rules by putting ramps and lifts in all of their stations so the disabled community can safely and easily board the trains.DOT has proposed a rule that would require all railroad stations to fully raise their platforms. It would be a very great cost to all the different railroads that service our people and then most passenger rail stations are serviced by multiple railroad companies with different train settings. Raising the platform will create major vertical and horizontal gaps between the trains and the platforms, making it harder for the disabled community to safely and efficiently enter and exit trains.The manager's amendment requires Amtrak to study how raising station platforms will affect the safe and efficient boarding of trains for all passengers.I fully support the manager's amendment and thank Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their work on the reauthorization of the bill which helps provide many needed improvements in the sadly lacking rail transportation, and hopefully will provide enticement to people leaving their cars at home, saving gasoline, arrive rested and avoid the traffic jams, creates for us in California a desperately needed program where we have three of the top five busiest rail corridors in the U.S., the Pacific Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin Corridors, alleviating the choke points and being able to help us look at the San Diego to Los Angeles San Francisco high-speed rail. It will help Metrolink, and I strongly support the passage of the manager's amendment in the bill.\", 'Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative.The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy.I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.', \"Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut.Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800.With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment.I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes.I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.\", \"Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering.It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country.This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules.I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products.On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health.I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.\", \"Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror.As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress.I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day.In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending:First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official.Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant.Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program.Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.\", \"Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security.E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply.The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify.E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective.Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better.But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system.Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility.Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens.This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system.The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns.Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work.Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.AARP,Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon. JIM MCCRERY, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\", 'Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours.We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it.Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January.In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.', \"Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise.In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue.Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families.Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.\", \"Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross.For the sake of our children's future, I'm strongly urging the Senate to ensure that the AMT patch that we're going to be considering this week complies with the PAYGO rules. The House has already passed a responsible AMT bill, which will prevent 23 million taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, while also finding appropriate offsets so that the national debt will not be increased.I have introduced a resolution, H.J. Res. 45, which is a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. If my constituents in upstate New York have to balance their checkbook every month, so should the Federal Government.The AMT affected 4.2 million Americans last year. If Congress does not act, it will affect 23 million Americans this year, most of them middle-class families.In my district, 66,000 families will be affected if this bill is not passed. Almost half of the 23 million taxpayers that will be affected are married with children. The average AMT taxpayer will owe over $6,000 in additional taxes. Small business owners are going to be one of the hardest hit by the AMT.The reason why we have to pay for this and ensure we follow pay-as-you-go standards is because America's debt is over $9 trillion. Our Federal debt increases by $1.4 billion a day, at an astonishing rate of $1 million a minute. Our national debt is equal to over $30,000 for every man, woman and child and infant in this country.The Federal Government spent over $400 billion last year on interest payments on the national debt. After Social Security, Medicare and defense spending, interest payments on the debt are the third largest expenditure by the Federal Government. The amount of money that we spend on interest payments will decrease the amount of money America will have in the future for spending on our national priorities such as health care, education, energy independence, our troops.Lowering the debt is essential not only for our economic security, but it is essential for our national security. Foreign governments and investors now hold $2.2 trillion, which is 44 percent of all publicly held U.S. debt. That's up nearly 10 percent from last year. China owns the second-most amount of our debt, and oil exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia account for the fourth-most held U.S. debt.Paying for AMT is possible. The House has already passed in a bipartisan way a PAYGO-compliant bill. For future generations, we must be responsible and not add to the national debt.Just to give folks at home an understanding of what this money means, let me just give you a couple of translations. This year we paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That same amount of money, if we use it for other purposes, would literally pay for every U.S. family's refrigerator to be stocked for 7 months. It would pay for filling every U.S. family's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices. It would pay for providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10 million students, and it would pay 1 year's salary for 8 million new teachers.The Federal Government has sent over $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and all road and bridge construction and improvements for the next 10 years.I beseech the Senate to follow a fiscal, responsible and prudent course of action and pay for the AMT.\", \"Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan.Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.\", \"Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill.I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15.But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child.Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.\", \"Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to several votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 3087, to require the President, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Res. 635, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith; ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 203, condemning the persecution of labor rights advocates in Iran; ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 2828, to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998; and ``yea'' on final passage of H. Con. Res. 200, condemning the violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful demonstrators in Burma and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\", 'Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy.Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase.The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market.Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year.Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress.This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely.It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit.Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis.By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region.It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans.This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country.Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.', \"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins.This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession.Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military.With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children.To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\", \"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group.Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China.Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway?Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns?Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds.Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs.In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions.Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments.Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount.I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.''This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this.Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com.And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.Treasury Gets New CFIUS AuthorityPresident Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers.The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.''At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.''Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.''``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland.The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports.CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step.``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said.The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company.However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government.As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies.A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.''The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.''One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval.The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement.CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms.U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security.3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign DealsWashington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public.This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight.Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies.``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment.But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.''Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.''In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation.Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews.A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes.When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.)Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses.``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.)As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations.A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies.Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation.The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said.Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media.Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment.Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement.Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.''Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee.Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill.``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.''The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist.Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid.Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms.Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive.Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.''Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same.Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors.Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal.Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee.Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington.U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons.Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments.Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash.Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''\", \"Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Madam Speaker, today we mark the seventh year that we commemorate National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. This is a bittersweet accomplishment. While I am proud to say that awareness of this epidemic's effect on the black community has grown over these 7 years, it pains me to admit that this disease continues to affect African Americans at a disproportionately large and growing rate.I consider the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic to be one of the most pressing issues of our time and of my tenure here as a Member of Congress. This issue attracted my concern years ago when I became aware of the staggering rate at which infants contract HIV from their mothers during birth or breast-feeding.I helped to raise awareness of this important issue when I came to Congress in 1996 through the introduction of and authorizing a bill and going to the Appropriations Committee to target the mother-to-child transmission. At that time, it was mother-to-child transmission internationally, and President Bush eventually incorporated aspects of my legislation in PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.While mother-to-child transmission continues to be a pressing problem abroad, we have shown some success in  fighting this here in the United States. The rate of perinatal HIV has decreased steadily from 122 in 2000 to 47 in 2004. Of course, the only acceptable rate of mother-to-child transmission is zero. However, we would do well to achieve a similar 60 percent reduction in all categories of HIV infection.So today we focus on the HIV epidemic among African Americans. The statistics are staggering, and it highlights the growing impact this epidemic has on African Americans.In 1985, blacks accounted for 25 percent of AIDS diagnosed, whereas in 2005 they accounted for 50 percent of new diagnoses. This statistic is all the more staggering because in 2005 African Americans only made up 12 percent of the population of this country.In 2005, 75 out of every 100,000 African Americans had AIDS, compared to only 7.5 out of every 100,000 whites.Perhaps more disturbing, African American women and children suffer at a rate that is even greater than that of African Americans overall.Black women accounted for 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women in 2005, compared to 16 percent among white women.In 2005, young African Americans accounted for only 15 percent of U.S. teens, yet they accounted for 75 percent of new AIDS cases.In 2002, HIV was the number one cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34, and this is why, Madam Speaker, that I started the first-of-its-kind AIDS Walk for minority women and children and dedicated that to minority women and children. We celebrated 10 years last year because of the staggering statistics that we are still faced with, and we will not stop until we eradicate this dreadful disease. It is ravishing the communities of Latinos, especially Latinas, African American women and both our children.The devastating effects of this epidemic have not escaped the notice of African American communities, in part due to the success of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Half of the African Americans say the HIV/AIDS is a more urgent problem than it was a few years ago, and indeed, it is. Half of African Americans also believe that the U.S. is losing ground in the fight against this epidemic domestically.Today is an important day in the effort to increase awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community. However, awareness is not enough. We must work toward solutions to reduce and eventually eradicate not only the racial disparities of HIV/AIDS, but the disease itself. To do so we must increase funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, particularly those that target minorities. We must strengthen our efforts to educate the public, particularly young people. We must work harder to encourage HIV testing, and we must also work to care for those who already have contracted this devastating illness.\", \"Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for their quick response to the surge in the nation's unemployment rate.H.R. 5749 will provide immediate relief to families across the country by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks in all states. It also allows for a further extension in benefits in states hardest hit by the weakening economy. Passing this legislation will provide much needed help to 3.8 million Americans--including 70,000 Minnesota families.The latest Labor Department report showed a 5 percent increase in unemployment from April 2008 to May 2008--the biggest one-month increase in unemployment in 22 years. The economic crisis has resulted in five months of job losses and projections unfortunately indicate that the situation is likely to worsen.An extension of unemployment benefits is critical for families struggling to deal with increased gas and food prices while searching for a new job. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, every $1 spent on these benefits results in $1.64 in new economic demand.We need to pass this legislation and provide relief for America's working families today. This Congress has also enacted an economic stimulus plan in the form of tax rebate checks and passed several measures to begin to address gas prices. In addition, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and a federal budget that would reinvest in Americans. In the long-term, we need a comprehensive approach to restore the strength of our economy. We need to get serious about addressing health care costs and invest in education and training to prepare for competition in the global economy.Madam Speaker, H.R. 5749 provides critical, immediate relief for working families and our struggling economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\", \"Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multi\\x1ccul\\x1ctural\\x1cism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.\", \"Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released.Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I missed three votes today due to an emergency dental procedure. Had I been present, I would have voted as follows:Rollcall vote 524: ``yes'' on motion on ordering the previous question on the rule providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules (H. Res. 1367).Rollcall vote 525: ``yes'' on H.

Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high.And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends.In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this.Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?\", \"Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag.The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States.Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors.I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation.And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", 'Ms. HOOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey who has done a fabulous job of chairing the subcommittee.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3580. Patients and consumers are the clear winners in this legislation today. This legislation will save lives by promoting the safe and quick approval of lifesaving medications and providing the FDA with vital new authority to protect consumers after a drug is on the market. This bill collects an additional $225 million over 5 years to enhance drug safety reviews and also promotes testing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to ensure that they are safe for children.Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip, pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and comprehensive drug and device safety bill.', \"Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity.In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill.During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity.The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5.78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union.75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive.The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits.I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired.Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo.And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.\", \"Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move.The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.''In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma.The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield.Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher.Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period.Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.\", \"Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my intrepid chairman, Mr. Dingell, and also Mr. Waxman, for their unfailing commitment to the public health of Americans. This bill is a good bill. When I first came to Congress, now 12 years ago, it seemed to be a bill far outside our reach.We had a number of hearings in those days, in which the tobacco manufacturers denied even that tobacco was addictive. To come from there to here is truly an extraordinary achievement, and I think we all agree that tobacco should be regulated by the FDA.One concern I still have in this bill is tobacco is illegal now for people under the age of 21. We all have seen through testimony throughout the years that the people who get addicted to tobacco tend to do so at an early age, and tobacco manufacturers have targeted young people consistently.I'm afraid that if the manufacturers say that they are targeting only adults, that what will happen will be they in fact will target young people, who will become addicted. That is why I was very pleased to include a provision in this law that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the public health implications of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. This report will be in to us within 5 years and we can see if there's more that we can do to protect our vulnerable young people from becoming the targets of advertising an improper addiction to tobacco.Madam Speaker, this truly is a great day for the health of Americans. I want to commend my chairman again.\", \"Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price.In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons.First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices.Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent.Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry.Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term.For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels.But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do.Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy.While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others.And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits.This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation.I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.\", \"Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity.I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.\", \"Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I hoped I would rise today in strong support of this SCHIP conference agreement that ensures millions of additional children access to health care.While I am pleased that we are increasing our investment in children's health, I'm deeply disappointed that final product denies health care to legal immigrant children.The Senate Republicans' failure to include the House-passed Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act in the conference agreement is a tragically missed opportunity to address existing health disparities among vulnerable legal immigrant children and pregnant women.More than 20 States, including California, have recognized that increasing access to care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women is good public health policy and cost-effective care.Unfortunately, this bill ignores that fact.This debate is not about immigration. This debate is about health care and our moral imperative to value the life of every child and to ensure that race and income do not determine the health status of any child in our wealthy Nation.\", \"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy.On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws.The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone.Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.\", \"Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress.At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans.I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.\", \"Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators.The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history.Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years.Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.\", 'Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act.Tactics that attempt to deceive or mislead voters regarding elections, candidates, or voting procedures chip away at the very cornerstone of our democracy: the right to vote. I strongly support this legislation because it will track and expose these tactics for what they are in order to continue to prove that we are not living up to the true meaning of democracy. Every vote is not being considered. Every vote is not being counted.Before and during the last election, there were reports of mass disenfranchisement and voter intimidation across the country. My district was subject to all types of deceptive flyers and phone calls targeted to black voters with misinformation designed to discourage them from voting. Mr. Speaker, as you know such tactics designed to prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote are not new. I am pleased that this legislation will make these types of acts a federal crime and set a penalty of up to 5 years in prison for any type of voter intimidation.I urge my colleagues to value and protect the right to vote by voting for this important legislation.', \"Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right.I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.''As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday.This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday.As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger.Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game.In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''\", \"Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and the ranking member, the chairperson of the full committee, Mr. Berman, and pay tribute to our good friends the late Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde, who have captured, in essence, what our war against HIV/AIDS is all about. It has to be comprehensive and expansive. It has to recognize the overlapping impact of tuberculosis and malaria.Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most telling scenes that I was able to experience, sadly so, was walking into a little hut in Zambia and seeing an emaciated body or person, if you will, being taken care of by a 4 year old. That individual had HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.So this legislation is crucial in the overall comprehensive war against the devastating diseases when there is no water, no nutrition, and poverty. This targets 12 million new HIV infections. It is treating millions of people. It's supporting care for 12 million. It has a focus on women and girls. It provides a focus on the anti-retroviral treatment that is so important that goes after opportunistic infections. It provides a certain amount of money, $9 billion, for malaria and tuberculosis over 5 years. It goes to the very essence of a 4 year old being the only remaining healthy person in his family having to care for sick relatives suffering from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and many suffering from malaria.This is an important step forward. And, yes, we have many responsibilities in this Congress. I join my friend from Iowa. We will be working hard to provide the support systems that those individuals need. But at the same time, this is a tribute to great leaders like our former and late chairpersons of this committee, Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, who recognized that to those who are given much, much is expected.This bill responds to the devastation and need around the world. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on not only an important issue in this country but around the world. I can only note that it gives me great pause that my colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos, did not live to see the fruit of his hard work on this bill. However, I know his family and his colleague Congressman Henry Hyde have kept this legislation alive and moving through this Congress.Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 on PEPFAR to come to the floor today.JACKSON-LEE AMENDMENTI would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that ``for the purposes of determining which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and (ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI, of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;''Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, ``of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.'' And even these large numbers are deceiving, as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.PEPFARIn January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; we are here today to discuss how to transition to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simplehealth problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we begin the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives.Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006.TUBERCULOSISThe World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that throughout the world someone contracts TB every second and that one third of all people in the world are currently infected with TB. Tuberculosis spreads easily from one person to another: when the infected person coughs, the bacilli or TB germs are spread into the air and another person need only to inhale a small number of the bacilli to be infected. The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that each person left untreated with active TB will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year. Although the TB bacilli can lie dormant in the body for years and its effects may not be immediately felt, if one has a weakened immune system, such as through HIV/AIDS, the chances of becoming sick will increase.In 2005, nearly 9 million people contracted tuberculosis, of which 84 percent occurred in high burden countries, with all but two of the high burden countries in Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the necessity for special attention to these high burden countries, particularly in Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 12 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection. About 80 percent of all cases in the world were found in 22 countries, all but 4 were found in Africa or Asia.Some 2.97 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB and about 2.57 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, sub-Saharan Africa was the only region in the world where TB prevalence was growing; elsewhere the number of cases was stable or falling. Despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology.Current restrictions on PEPFAR mandating that 1/3 of all prevention funds must be used on abstinence-only education neglect the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner. Removing these stipulations would allow PEPFAR to better address  the requirements of each country, making more efficient andeffective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease.In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs.Mr. Speaker, if we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS causes to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs.HIV/AIDSI want to share briefly the importance of continued action in awareness for this virulent disease and the nexus between TB and HIV/AIDS, another issue which I am passionate about and would like to see eradicated as I am sure many of my colleagues would. According to the World Health Organization, there were 33.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2007.People living with HIV/AIDS are at a greater risk of becoming infected with TB because of their weakened immunity. In 2004, out of the more than 740,000 people who contracted TB and were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, 600,000 of those co-infected were found in sub-Saharan Africa.Similar to TB, HIV/AIDS has risen to epidemic levels particularly for our African countrymen. According to UNAIDS, in 2005, there were 3.2 million newly infected Africans and 2.4 million Africans who died of HIV/AIDS related complications. The current life expectancy for a person living with AIDS in Africa is 47 years old.Such high rates of infection can be prevented. The transmission of HIV can be reduced through proper education and resources. Additionally, proper resources can help the treatment of HIV. We must make these resources more accessible to those who need it most.MALARIAMalaria is another disease that must be addressed. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500 million people become severely ill with malaria and more than one million people die of malaria every year, mostly infants, young children and pregnant women. Perhaps most shocking is WHO's estimate that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. More than 90 percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa.Mr. Speaker, malaria is both preventable and curable. Early and effective treatment can shorten its duration and prevent the development of complications and the great majority of deaths.\", \"Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States.The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there.With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families.Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence.Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land.In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums.Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home.Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.\", \"Ms. BEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the stimulus package that will strengthen the economic health of our businesses, our Nation, and the families we represent. Recently, I introduced legislation to double the section 179 expense tax deduction, which allows small business owners to write off expenses immediately. I am pleased that this meaningful tax incentive was included in the House stimulus package, which encourages small businesses to increase investment and hiring.In my district, Chris Dahm, owner of Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Illinois, is an example of how this will make a difference. In 1980, Chris started his company with one truck; 28 years later, he has a fleet of 33. His success, like small businesses across the country, is a cornerstone of our economy. However, over the last 3 months, his business has declined and he has reduced the workweek for many of his drivers. When I talked to Chris about this incentive, he said, ``If something like this came out, I'd go full speed.'' Instead of stalling expansion plans, he would invest now.I commend our leadership and administration in crafting this bipartisan legislation and urge its swift passage.\", \"Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his excellent management of this legislation on the floor today. I want to commend him, as well as commending Mr. Lampson for this legislation, which he has worked on for a very long time and which makes very good sense for the American people. I also thank Mr. Markey for his extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.The choice that we have before us today, my colleagues, is a simple one. The price at the pump is one that is a problem and challenge to the paycheck-to-paycheck economic security of America's families. It must be brought down.There are two goals that we have in what we are doing here. One is to protect the consumer. That is a responsibility that we have. And in order to do that, to increase the supply of oil that will help bring down the price at the pump.This week we have the SPR bill to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Next week we will have the speculation bill which will address the issue of undue, excessive speculation in the oil markets and what impact that may have on the price of oil.In the course of this debate, I think it's important to remember some fundamentals, and one of them is the following. The United States Government is sitting on a stockpile of oil, 700 million barrels of oil. This fact is well known to you in the course of the debate, I know, 700 million barrels of oil. This is oil that the taxpayers have paid for and in some cases have paid a very expensive price for, and it is there.The President is sitting on that oil. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it is reserved for an emergency. The difference of an opinion that we have here is, is it an emergency that the American people are facing the prices at the pump that they have and home heating oil and the rest.We say it's an emergency, but an emergency that would justify our taking not more than, well, we would take it down to, I think it's 90 percent of what is in the SPR. The SPR, as I said, has 700 million barrels, and 97.5 percent of this stockpile, this government stockpile, is filled. It's fuller than it's ever been in history. It's an historic supply.So what we are saying to the President is just take a small amount of that. Free our oil. This oil has been paid for by taxpayers' dollars. Free our oil, increase the supply on the market, and within 10 days the price at the pump can come down.A while back, we asked the President to stop filling the reserve. Imagine, we were buying oil at top dollar this spring to keep filling this stockpile. The President refused. This Congress voted overwhelmingly in both Houses to stop filling the SPR, recognizing that as we pulled oil out of the supply and into the stockpile, we were affecting the price at the pump.This time we are saying it hasn't come down enough, certainly not for America's consumers. We need you now to do the reverse, to follow up on that, not only not fill the stockpile, but to increase the supply in the marketplace.Every time this has been done, and it has been done three times in the last 20 years. Every time this has been done, and you have seen the charts here, Mr. Markey has those charts. Every time it has been done, the price of oil has come down.So it's a proven way to bring the price at the pump down. When the price of oil comes down in a very sound, market-oriented way, we will buy oil cheaper to replace this oil that we took out and sold at a higher price and make a profit on it.It makes all the sense in the world to do it this way. Those who oppose this are using this argument that instead of releasing the oil from the stockpile, government-owned stockpile, paid for by the consumer and the taxpayer, instead of releasing this oil to increase the supply in the market, we should be drilling more. We should be drilling in protected areas.Even the President has said that that is not any short-term fix. Everybody recognizes that if you drill, that it takes 10 years to affect the price at the pump, and only about 2 cents at that.So instead of saying only drill, only drill and get a 2 percent benefit 10 years from now, we are saying release the oil from this stockpile so that we can have a price at the pump result in 10 days, not 10 years. This is part of what we brought forth last week, too--use it or lose it.Democrats support drilling. It's important in this debate to recognize that there are 68 million acres in our country which have permits and are ready to go for drilling. So we are saying to the oil companies, use it or lose it. Use your permits, drill for oil, but don't say I don't want to drill there where I have an environmental permit to drill, I want to go drill in some protected area, which is going to take longer for me to do, by the way. And the reason I'm not drilling so much where I'm allowed to is I don't have the equipment to do it.See this for the hoax on the American people that it is. Yes, we are saying drill, use it or lose it as a way to increase domestic supply. We are also saying you increase domestic supply by investing in renewable energy resources, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest. No less a stalwart Republican than T. Boone Pickens is saying, ``I'm for everything.'' He's for drilling, he's for wind, he's for solar, he's for natural gas, he's for alternatives to foreign oil. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, not only for our economy but for the economics of America's families and for our consumers.It is an environmental health issue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and especially foreign oil. And it is a moral issue, because it has an impact on how we preserve our planet. That's why we have so many evangelicals supporting our efforts for renewables rather than fossil fuels.So it is an important debate that we are having, because this argument that we shouldn't have oil today on the market, which will reduce the price in 10 days, but, instead, should be drilling where we are not allowed to and have a 2-cent saving in 10 years, think of it. This isn't a reason, this is an excuse, and it's an excuse for a failed energy policy.It is the energy policy of the Bush administration and some of the Republicans in Congress, but not all, because many have voted in an enlightened way on this subject. This is an excuse for their failed energy policy. These are the same people, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who brought us over $4 a gallon gasoline at the pump. And now they are saying more of the same.We are saying a new direction. And now we can drill, we can increase the supply, we can invest in renewables, we can end speculation, we can protect the consumer. As we do all of that, including the drilling, we can do it now, and we can do it right. The fastest way to help the consumer is to release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but let's think of that as a government stockpile paid for by taxpayers' dollars that a small amount can have a big impact.I urge my colleagues to go down the same path you did before when overwhelmingly over 300 Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted to stop filling the SPR. Now let's just say there is so much in there, you can spare some to help the consumer. Do it right. Do it right now.I urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important legislation.Again, I would commend Mr. Markey, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Lampson, the author of this legislation. I thank you, Mr. Lampson, for your leadership.\", 'Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation.A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy.Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA.What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run.I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential.My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout.When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror.I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past.But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism.I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.', \"Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\", \"Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the ``in-out plan,'' as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.In order to participate in this bailout, a company will essentially give stock options to the Treasury Secretary, who will be able to exercise those options at whatever price he decides.How will the markets be changed when the Federal Government is the largest single stockholder in the country? Senator OBAMA is the most liberal Senator in the history of this country, someone who seeks to socialize large sectors of the economy.With passage of this bill, it is now pertinent to ask how will our companies and markets fare under OBAMA and Federal Government and consolidated liberal Democrat controlled government?I think not well, and for any company forced into this deal with the devil, they are barred from negotiating, complaining or seeking judicial recourse.Do you like 10 trillion in debt? In one stroke of the pen, Congress will have expanded the debt by another trillion to 11.3 trillion.What happens if any of this money is repaid? Democrats won't have to make any effort to expand their spending for more Federal Government; that spending will have already been authorized in this bill.Which brings me to another financial mess buried in these pages. Any premium paid by companies will be put into a fund, like the Social Security trust fund. And we all know how well that has worked out well for Social Security.What's worse, these premiums will be counted against the deficit, allowing for more spending, higher pay-go, and will finance more federal bureaucracy. Democrats are rapacious for more spending. You can count on this.If you weren't angry enough about this bailout, foreign banks get special treatment. Right there in Section 112, the Treasury Secretary has the discretion to bailout foreign banks at the expense of the American taxpayer. No restrictions and no guarantees.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner has paid for your energy schemes this year with higher gas prices. Now you want the middle class homeowner to pay for your housing schemes.My biggest concern is that this bill creates two classes of homeowners.There are those homeowners who make every mortgage payment, and pay every bill and struggle to meet their commitments, and there are those homeowners, like Representative RICHARDSON, who didn't meet their obligations, skipped out on the bills and now want the taxpayer to bail them out.This is all too embarrassing and it turns my stomach.Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This is the same crowd delivering the same bills and expecting the middle class homeowner to pick up the tab.Madam Speaker, the American homeowner is tired of being your piggy bank. The American homeowner is sick of your promises and platitudes and is simply not going to stand for this.\", \"Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Chair, let's be clear about what this act does: it sidesteps a free and fair election process, and it subjects hardworking Americans to coercion and intimidation.At a time when my hometown is proud to report twice the national average in job growth, job growth in manufacturing, high-tech construction, this bill heads us in the wrong direction.I want to focus on health care. We have all heard the concerns about a growing workforce shortage in this country. The card check process for unionization further puts health care at risk. It would discourage much-needed health care professionals from entering into the health care field.I have heard from Ferry County Hospital and from Dayton General Hospital, both small, critical-access hospitals in eastern Washington, that this bill would increase costs and is a slap in the face for collaboration between management and employees.What is the biggest concern for these hospitals, the undue pressure on their employees. Rich Umbdenstock, who is the president of the American Hospital Association and past president of the former Providence Services in Spokane, Washington, said, ``The hardworking men and women of our Nation's hospitals are entitled to choice.'' I couldn't agree more. They have it right.Hospital employees should have the same right in choosing their labor representative as they do in choosing their elected representatives.As eastern Washington's voice in this House, I must object on behalf of individuals and families that I represent. I will vote against this bill in public so as to preserve the citizens' right to do so in private.\", 'Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1174.', \"Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families.This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys.The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy.Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.\", \"Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.\", 'Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of NASA.With the exception of apple pie and baseball, few reflections resonate across America of how proud we are of all of the work that NASA has done.Since its inception in 1958, NASA has been the leading agency for American and global innovation. Indeed, the creation of NASA was responsible for introducing a whole new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians here in the United States.Likewise, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of NASA, it is important to adhere to the continuing commitment we should make as a Nation to embrace innovation, and reach the unachievable, but we, as Members of Congress, must back that up with funding.As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I was fortunate to view in person the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on March 10, 2008, where I witnessed at night the best and the brightest orchestrated through its operations and through its making history.From making commercial aviation safer, to studying climate change, and strengthening international partnerships, which we desperately need at this time, the scientists at NASA continue to do advanced research on the issues that affect our daily lives.I would like to applaud my colleague on the Science and Technology Committee, Representative McCaul, for bringing this thoughtful resolution to the floor and also to Mr. Lampson for his commitment to this issue.I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary, and we hope that there will be many to come.']\n"
