Exercise 1
What will the following Python program print out?
>>> def fred():
    print "Zap"
>>> def jane():
    print "ABC"

>>> jane()
>>> fred()
>>> jane()

Ans:
d) ABC Zap ABC

The 3x statements will call the functions sequentially which in turn print some text.

Exercise 2
Rewrite the pay computation program that you created in Week 2 with time-and-a-half for overtime and create a function called computepay that takes two parameters (hours and rate).
#!/usr/bin/python

def computepay(hours, rate):
    print('Pay: {:.2f}'.format(int(hours) * int(rate)))

in_hours = input('Enter hours:')
in_rate = input('Enter rate:')

computepay(in_hours, in_rate)

Output:
$ python3 Sharat_Sripada_Functions_4.2.py
Enter hours:45
Enter rate:20
Pay: 900.00
